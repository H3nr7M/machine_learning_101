# Machine learning 101

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that has transformed the way we approach problems in a variety of domains, including finance, healthcare, and technology. At its core, machine learning involves building algorithms that can automatically learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

If you're new to machine learning, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. This repository provides a basic introduction to machine learning, we going to focus on supervised learning, which is the most common type of machine learning problem. We will also cover some of the most important concepts in machine learning, and we build a model and do all the process from scratch.

So let's get started!
